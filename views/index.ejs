                    Hunger has been on the rise for several years since the last few years. 
                    Today, up to 811 million people suffer from hunger and 3 billion cannot afford a healthy diet, 
                    and around 5.7 per cent  of children under five years are affected by overweight. 
                    Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerabilities and inequalities have increased, 
                    particularly for women in rural areas, children and indigenous peoples.

                    About 15 percent of India is undernourished. This statistic may not initially seem significant, 
                    but 15% of 1.34 billion people is roughly 199 million people. To put this in perspective, 
                    199 million people is more than half of the United States. Currently, organizations such as the 
                    Fight Hunger Foundation, Khasla Aid Services, Food For the Hungry, Meals on Wheels Association have 
                    begun to battle the issue, but it remains prevalent.

                    India ranks 97th in addressing hunger. The countryâ€™s condition is worse than many believe. 
                    Despite being an economic powerhouse, India lacks the resources to properly fix its hunger issue. 
                    Foreign aid from other nations has helped in remedying part of the problem. The lack of food available 
                    for Indian children, amongst other factors, means that that a shocking one out of every twenty children 
                    die before their fifth birthday.
